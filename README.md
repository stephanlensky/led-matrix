# led-matrix

Animation designer, simulator and server for a 64x64 HUB75 LED matrix driven by an Adafruit Matrix Portal S3.

## Layout

- `packages/core` — frame model, effects, animation schema and renderer shared by server and web
- `apps/server` — Fastify API and playback engine (runs TypeScript directly on Node)
- `apps/web` — Vite + React frontend with the panel simulator

## Development

Requires Node 26+ and pnpm 12.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev      # server on :3000, web on :5173
pnpm check    # format, lint, typecheck, test
```
